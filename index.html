       <h3>A new beginning...</h3>
       <p>People think that life is on repeat and you go through the same stuff every day. That has happened to me before, but
        dont have to deal with that anymore. Today is a new beginning. I have good friends and go to a good school. But, it could change in a flash.</p>
